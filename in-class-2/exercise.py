# BONUS (optional): Python has a built-in function, enumerate(), that numbers items for you.
# Rewrite your code for #1 so it uses enumerate() instead of adding 1 each time.
# Your output should stay exactly the same, so check.py still passes.
# Look it up: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate
# (Hint: it starts counting at 0 unless you tell it otherwise.)
